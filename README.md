# CM2030_WebcamPiano

This project is an example of utilizing computer vision to create smart images.
This is a simpler version of the work done by Memo Akten.

The project takes input from a webcam and passes the image data through a filter process to remove the background and all other nonessential information. It then uses this simplified data to detect motion and draws an image to the screen based off what detects.

This was one of four mini projects that amounted to my Final submission for CM2030 Graphics Programming

The other projects were:
  
  CM2030_3DSinGames
  CM2030_averageFace
  CM2030_InstagramFilter

This project utilizes JavaScript and the p5.js library to implement a series of image filters.
